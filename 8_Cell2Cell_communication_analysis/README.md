# Cell-Cell communication analysis
The folder contains the R files used to run two kind of cell-cell communication analysis. We used Cellchat for having a first idea of the ligand-receptor communications between our celltype of interest, and nichenet analysis have further information about the differentially expressed ligands across conditions and the activated downstream genes in the receptor cells.
